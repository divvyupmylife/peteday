  <div><p>The future nav bar will be under this paragraph, I'll rant about Nav bars anyways!
    They aren't elements you get to endlessly recycle with css!
    Isn't that dumb? No, you have to add the navigation on your own in every single page!
    Like, what?
    Also, this paragraph BETTER be padded!
  </p></div>
  <p>Besides my rant, I should briefly explain my choice of pages.
    Gallery will be artist submissions.
    History will explain the history of the character.
    About will explain why the site exists.
    Last and not least, Flavors will demonstrate various Pete designs.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the future front page of the Pete Day website. Before Pete Day next year, this page will be ready!
  </p>
  <p>
    Does the paragraph change?
  </p>
    <p>
    Okay!
    </p>
    <p>
    Next year is Pete's 100th Anniversary!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouldn't forget that this is the page where I try everything. Maybe it'll be deprecated one day, but for now...
    </p>
    <a href=link.html>Is this going to work?<br>
    I got it to work! I used what's called a relative url<br>
    in contrast to the absolute url.</a>
    <div class="container">
    <img src="Disney-Villains-disney-villains-6904445-1024-768.jpg" alt="Villain Pete"></div>
    <p>I could make a custom width and height,<br>but I'd rather see what happens.<br></p>
    <div class="container">
    <img src="naked_pete_in_hat.jpg" alt="Naked Pete"></div>
    <p>Now I'm testing the style width in contrast to controlling it here.</p>
    <img src="naked_pete_in_hat.jpg" alt="Naked Pete" style="width:100%"></div>
    <p>Let's also try overriding. Update: It didn't work because I didn't use style, so let's try that!</p>
