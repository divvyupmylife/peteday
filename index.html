    February 15 is Pete Day!
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>
    This is the future front page of the Pete Day website. Before Pete Day next year, this page will be ready!
  </p>
  <p>
    Does the paragraph change?
  </p>
    <p>
    Okay!
    </p>
    <p>
    Next year is Pete's 100th Anniversary!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouldn't forget that this is the page where I try everything. Maybe it'll be deprecated one day, but for now...
    </p>
    <a href=link.html>Is this going to work?</a>

    <p>I could make a custom width and height, but I'd rather see what happens.</p>
