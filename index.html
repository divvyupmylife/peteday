    February 15 is Pete Day!
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>
    This is the future front page of the Pete Day website. Before Pete Day next year, this page will be ready!
  </p>
  <p>
    Does the paragraph change?
  </p>
    <p>
    Okay!
    </p>
    <p>
    Next year is Pete's 100th Anniversary!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shouldn't forget that this is the page where I try everything. Maybe it'll be deprecated one day, but for now...
    </p>
    <a href=link.html>Is this going to work?<br>
    I got it to work! I used what's called a relative url<br>
    in contrast to the absolute url.</a>
    <img src="Disney-Villains-disney-villains-6904445-1024-768.jpg" alt="Villain Pete">
    <p>I could make a custom width and height,<br>but I'd rather see what happens.<br></p>
    <img src="naked_pete_in_hat.jpg" alt="Naked Pete" height=200>
    <p>Testing just height alone. Hopefully, the width automatically adjusts, too!</p>
